I want to generate an tool that does the following things:
- Locates scientific journals that have open access to their articles and those articles' supplementary materials. These journals and any identified journal API endpoints that allow article and supplementary material download are stored in modular form where they can easily be swapped out.
	- Initially, the three journals with the highest impact factors that meet the above criteria are selected, but the journal names and relevant API endpoints are stored in modular form where they can easily be swapped out and added to.
- Goes issue by issue through all of the journal's volumes that are published online with open access, starting with the most recent volumes and issues. For each issue, it identifies articles that are likely to have code in their supplementary material sections (e.g., it looks for references to words like, "code" or "github", etc. in the main journal article). These key words to query the articles against are stored in modular form where they can easily be swapped out and added to. When an article with a high probability of containing code in the supplementary material is identified, the supplementary material is downloaded temporarily.
- After a maximum of 10 (this number is modifiable) of supplementary material bundles are downloaded, the supplementary files are then examined, identifying any code files in any computer language.
- For each candidate file identified above, the file is to be inspected (but NOT RUN) by an AI agent. That agent checks for obvious coding mistakes. Styling quirks are ignored, as are missing optimizations. Instead, highly-probable overt errors are to be identified.
- For each supplementary material bundle coming from a single journal article, those errrors identified above are collated into a summary and emailed to the journal's primary author. For now, temporarily, those emails are to be sent to mark.aaron.fisher@gmail.com instead. The subject line of the email should read, "Potential errors in supplementary code for article {articleName}", where {articleName} is the name of that journal article.
- Summaries that have already been sent and articles, journals, volumes, and issues that have already been scanned are persisted in a database such that they don't get queried again in a fresh run of the tool.
